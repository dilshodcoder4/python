# WHAT IS THE PROGRAM ?
# Input data==>Manipulate data ==>Return
# OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING 
# * A very common programming paradigm (style designing software )
# * Make developing large software projects and more intuitive
# * Allows us think of complex software in terms of real world objects and their relationships to one another 

# OBJECTS 
# * An entinty thing in your program often a noun 
# * Example of an object could be single person 
# Properties 
# * Name
# * Age 
# * Address
# BEHAVIROS 
# * Walk 
# * Talk 
# * Breathe 

# CLASSES
# * Classes are used to create obects
# * We can use many, unique objects from a single classes
# * Classed define a type 
# * The procces of creating an objects from a class is called instantion .
# Here we create a new veriable called my_name with a value of Austin.The variable
# is actually a reference in order to create it , we instated the built in str class
# exaple 
my_name="Dilshod"
# Example :Doors     
# door class 
# Properties:
#     heigh 
#     color 
#     is_locked 
    
# Behaviors:
#     open()
#     closed()
#     toggle_lock ()
        

#    door1                      door2  
# heigh 89                    heigh 89      
# color red                   color red
# is_locked False             is_locked False

# opnen()                     opnen() 
# closed()                    closed()
# toggle_lock()               toggle_lock()
