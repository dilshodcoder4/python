# Variable name and value
order=25

# how to print out the value  by using print()-function
print(order)


# we can aslo print value directly 
print(25)

# however using variable name is good when we change the value  after fact
# for example
age=25
print(age)
age=45
print(age)

# In fact,Variables can include letters,numbers  and underscores while they can not start with numbers
# when longer variables names are written in  snake_case in Pyhton

father_age=50
team_number=3

# Variable names you will never change are written in all uppercase
